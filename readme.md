# Texas Community Health News

We collect, organize and document over 120 county-level variables from public sources such as the Texas Department of State Health Services, the US Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Because public health is a complex topic that is impacted by wide ranging factors and that crosses organizational lines, our dataset provides value to reporters and researchers by bringing together otherwise disparate variables with detailed documentation. Additionally, we provide analysis and visualizations in easy-to-use formats that make data-driven reporting accessible to organizations that otherwise lack the requisite resources.

This repositoryy contains scripts used to process data included in our county-level dataset, as well as additional datasets related to special topics and projects. To download data and visualizations, go to [texascommunityhealthnews.org](http://www.texascommunityhealthnews.org).
